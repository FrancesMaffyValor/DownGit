<br>    "Manicure" is a word that is typically familiar among women. However, it is actually quite common for men to indulge 
<br> in manicures too, especially before an important event such as a wedding or business opportunity. People often get or <br> give themselves manicures for various reasons. Sometimes it's to simply be pampered, as getting a professional manicure <br> is often a very relaxing experience. Other times it's to get ready for special events, or to simply look one's best on a <br> daily basis.
<br> 
<br> Manicures can be done at the home or in a salon, with most people choosing to head to a salon. This is because salons <br> provide several options for the ultimate manicure. For example, you can choose from hundreds of shades of nail polish or <br> choose a customized manicure. French manicures are often a popular choice among women obtaining a professional manicure. <br> Other popular options include American manicures, diamond nails, gel nails, and having cute, trendy designs painted on <br> your nails. If you don't know the difference between these types of manicures, this article will help you choose which <br> on is right for you.
<br> 
<br>     An American manicure closely resembles the French manicure. It's beautiful, subtle, and classy all at the same time. <br> The major difference is that the American manicure is thought by many women to look more natural than the French look. <br> American manicures usually do not contain a color base, but are painted clear or an opaque white prior to painting the <br> tips. The tips are still painted white, but don't appear as bright as French manicures.Diamond nail manicures are a <br> slightly more expensive form of manicure, but for very good reason. The concept formed from creating a base coat made <br> from real diamonds, which bond to form a hard, protective coating over the actual fingernail. This provides a glamorous <br> look while helping the nails to grow rapidly. Some places may not use a base coat containing actual diamonds, but the <br> concept and look remains the same. Gel nail manicures are done using an acrylic base over the top of the actual nail, <br> providing strength to enhance the growth of the nails. It should be known that eventually this layer begins to break <br> off, but some women prefer to keep up this form of manicure to keep their nails hard and strong.
<br> 
<br>   For those opting to do their manicures at home, it's possible to achieve the same professional look for a lot less. <br> Look for professional manicure kits. You can choose from a French, American, or classic (a color is applied to your <br> entire nail) manicure kit. If your nails are long enough, you can purchase the kits with adhesive strips to help you <br> perfect the white line that is painted over the tips. If you have short nails but wish to make them look longer, you <br> will need to purchase artificial tips and the supplies needed for these manicures acrylic powder, bonding solution, <br> professional nail cutting scissors, and a buffer. Sometimes you can purchase the acrylic kits already containing these <br> items. However, be careful when choosing an acrylic kit. Choose one from a reputable manufacturer, or visit a beauty <br> supply store where the kits are the same ones used in nail salons.
